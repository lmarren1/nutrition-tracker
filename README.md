# Nutrition Tracker

## Note to the Reader

This project is **in-progress** and will not be functional until late January 2023.

## Purpose

Popular fitness apps collect user nutrition, exercise, and weight data seamlessly but seriously lack in providing any real analysis of what it all means. 

This Shiny app is designed to answer the 'why?'s behind your fitness journey. Users can better understand their progress via digestible yet in-depth statistical and regression analysis. All you have to do is track your data!

## TODO
- App Preview 
- Setup (include notes on Google forms / sheets data collection)
- Note on Statistical Analysis
- Note on Regression Analysis
